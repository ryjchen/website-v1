      <h4>Client</h4>
      <p>Our client is a software company that utilizes the intersection of strategy, marketing, technology, and innovation to “build the software today for inventions of tomorrow.” The company focuses highly in the craftsmanship of their agile software development, workspaces, and community engagement. The company builds their digital experiences through pairing, test-driven development, and practices the values of agile manifesto before anyone else. .</p>
      <h4>Initial Client Problem</h4>
      <p>Pillar has an award-winning open-office workspace, however we are challenged with scaling. We have underutilized telepresence technology, an unrealized vision for a maker space, and altogether inefficient seating and space usage strategy.</p>
      <p>Additionally, we share our office with the UM Desai Incubator and host events (during and after hours). To make matters worse, our consultants spend some of their time at client locations meaning we will have anywhere from 20-60 people in the office on any given day. When those numbers are highest, we most likely have a large number of clients on site, further emphasizing the need for our space usage to be "on brand" and intentionally designed.</p>
      <h4>Revised Client Problem</h4>
      <p>Throughout the day and week, the number of people in the Ann Arbor office space can vary greatly with employees working on and off sites and clients’ freedom to employ the Pillar Technology space. There is underutilization of Pillar Technology’s technological and spatial resources for which the company seeks to find solutions to make the best use of their technologies and space while increasing work efficiency and community engagement. There is currently a room used as their printing room, but was meant to be a makerspace.</p>

      <p>In addition to concerns about the makerspace, our consulting team discovered that many of the concerns and issues raised explicitly by employees and unearthed by multiple interviews revolved around restricted communication lines between employees and management.</p>

      <h4 class="center">Findings Related to Restricted Communication Flow</h4>
      <p>Our consulting team identified some areas of concern regarding communication between employees early in the project. From the initial meeting through the interviews, each employee we talked to was excited to talk about the culture of the company, which is hugely important to its success. Although the organizational structure is ostensibly flat, we found evidence in our interviews that employees have stratified themselves to a point that specific bottlenecks have formed.</p>
      <p>Although the makerspace was the initial focus of the project, the consulting team found that several of the roadblocks to moving on the foundation of a makerspace, as well as issues with other concerns our client raised at the outset of the project, could probably be resolved by tackling the communication restrictions.</p>

      <h4 class="center">Findings Related to Makerspace</h4>
      <p>The employees who participated in the interviews for this project are excited about the makerspace idea, and many had unique ideas of what the makerspace could look like. The consulting team felt it was critical to evaluate what employees hoped the space will look like and what they hope to do with it. In the two years since the idea of founding a makerspace in The Forge originated, there are a few factors which have consistently kept Pillar from realizing the makerspace. The consulting team feels it is important that Pillar identify and address these long-standing issues before forging ahead with the makerspace.</p>
